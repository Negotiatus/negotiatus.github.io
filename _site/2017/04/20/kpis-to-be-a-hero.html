<h3 id="kpis-key-performance-indicators-measurable-values-demonstrating-how-effectively-companies-achieve-key-business-objectives"><em>KPIs (key performance indicators): measurable values demonstrating how effectively companies achieve key business objectives</em></h3>

<p>You have the top negotiators on your team and they’ve been maximizing your savings for years. But what if we told you that isn’t always enough? The responsibilities of the procurement process can actually span across several internal departments (warehousing, logistics, sales &amp; finance) as well as external organizations such as suppliers, carriers &amp; freight forwarders.</p>

<p>There are multiple factors that determine the success of your procurement department. Collecting and examining specific KPIs over time can help you measure the success of your business’ cost-savings goals and really zone in on the areas that will make the greatest impact. Procurement KPIs must be SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic &amp; time-based) and developed in conjunction with company goals at large.</p>

<p>While KPIs can differ from company to company, we’ve compiled a list of mission-critical KPIs that you can improve via procurement best practices.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p><strong>1) Total Cost Savings:</strong> the aggregate amount of money procurement saves by reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) from one year to the next <em>excluding changes in volume</em>.</p>

<p><strong>2) # of Incorrect Orders:</strong> a key way to measure progress being made towards “betterment of quality.”</p>

<p>Quality KPI alternatives can include # of returns processed and dollar amount required to fix the incorrect orders.</p>

<p><strong>3) Delivery:</strong> the % of on-time total shipments.</p>

<p>This KPI measures how well the procurement department gets what the organization needs when it needs it, included but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delivery to promised date</li>
  <li>Delivery to (original) schedule date</li>
  <li>Delivery to rescheduled dates</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3) Procurement Cycle Time:</strong> the average time it takes between requisition submission and PO placement is one measure of procurement cycle time.</p>

<p>This can also be measured as the time it takes from the beginning of a sourcing process to the time that an order is placed.</p>

<p><strong>4) Percentage of Active Suppliers Accounting for 80% of Total Spend:</strong> measures the current state of supplier consolidation &amp; activity.</p>

<p>This KPI measures the current state of supplier consolidation and activity within the supply base from the year period, driving efficiencies within the procurement organization and driving down costs/PO. Often impacted by new product introductions &amp; changes in sales within the product portfolio. Most companies should set a KPI goal to have 80% of their spend going through 20% of their suppliers.</p>

<p><strong>5) % of Managed Spend over Total Spend:</strong></p>

<p>Managed spend is the amount of spend that the purchasing department influences through the sourcing process. Total spend is the amount of money the company spends on products &amp; services each year (not including labor costs).</p>

<p>Spend under management (SOM) can be as high as 85% in companies with best-in-class strategic sourcing departments.</p>

<p><strong>6) Inventory Turnover Ratio:</strong> forecasted COGS sold over the next 12 months / current inventory value.</p>

<p>An industry average to keep in mind is three. Finding a purchasing analytics platform to forecast future ordering can be super helpful in keeping inventory stocked without over-ordering.</p>

<p>Capturing these baseline KPIs promotes ongoing compliance and identifies areas of additional cost-saving opportunities.
